# MWS-Restaurant-3

This project added some more functionality such as the ability to chose whether a particular restaurant is your favorite or not and also adds a review form to the existing database.

What do I do from here? In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. The method that worked for me was py -m http.server 8000

If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like. You will notice it is responsive for the most common devices out there under Developer Tools.
