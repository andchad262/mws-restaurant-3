# Chef Rate

In this app project, I converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. First, I took a static design that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for my users. Next, I made the application accessible across multiple devices. In addition, users are able to write new reviews and add a restaurant as a favorite. 

## Architecture
The application is built using sails.js and node.js on the backend which is hosted on Glitch. A front end version can be found here https://codechad.github.io/chef-rate
