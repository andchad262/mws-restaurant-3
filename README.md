# Chef Rate

In this app project, I converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. First, I took a static design that lacked accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for my users. Next, I made the application accessible across multiple devices. In addition, users are able to write new reviews and add a restaurant as a favorite. 

## Architecture
The application is built using sails.js and node.js on the backend and deployed on Glitch. The front end is built on the Leaflet Maps API with bounce markers to navigate restaurant locations and click to the restaurant page. User can also chose from neighboorhoods or cuisines from the drop down menus to narrow down selections. At each restaurant page, user has the ability to write a new review https://codechad.github.io/chef-rate
